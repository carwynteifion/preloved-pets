            We run several campaigns throughout the year to raise awareness and

            there are many ways you can get involved and support our mission.

          <h3>Building a Wing for Reptiles and Fish</h3>
          <p>
            We are currently raising funds to build a new wing to house reptiles
            and fish. The initial goal to build the wing, including 1 terrarium,
            2 medium-sized aquariums, and running costs, is £20,000. For every
            additional £20,000 raised, we have set the following stretch goals:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>£40,000: 1 additional terrarium</li>
            <li>£60,000: 2 additional large aquariums</li>
            <li>
              £80,000: An educational centre for visitors to learn about
              reptiles and fish
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We will post additional stretch goals if the above ones are met!

          <h2>Past Campaigns</h2>
          <p>
            Our past campaigns have helped us achieve great things for pets in
            need. Learn more about our previous efforts and the impact they have
            had on our community. Your support has made all of this possible,
            and we are grateful for your continued involvement.

          <h3>Adopt-a-Thon</h3>
          <p>
            Our Adopt-a-Thon event was a huge success, with over 100 pets
            finding their forever homes. We partnered with local businesses and
            organisations to host the event, which featured pet adoptions,
            educational workshops, and fun activities for the whole family.
          </p>
          <h3>Spay and Neuter Drive</h3>
          <p>
            Our Spay and Neuter Drive helped reduce the number of unwanted pets
            in our community. We offered free spay and neuter services to pet
            owners in need, helping to prevent overpopulation and reduce the
            strain on local shelters.
