# Preloved Pets

## USW IS1S484 - Design Brief

### Objectives

The objectives of the site can be derived from the requirements of the client, Preloved Pets.
Being a small, self-funded charity, the single main goal for the website is to provide a
human-centric platform to secure donations. Doing this provides the means for the site to
achieve its secondary goals, which are:
- To boost the success of finding homes for pets;
- To promote volunteering opportunities;
- To promote funding campaigns such as for building a reptile and fish facility.
- To ensure an enjoyable and accessible user experience

The long-term goal is to successfully advertise the centre to the wider public, ensuring
consistent site traffic so that the other goals continue to be met.

Achieving the single main goal will primarily be through the site's design, using a hero
banner on the main page with a call-to-action button to donate. In addition, donation
links will be present at the bottom of each page, as well as in strategic places on the
site such as alongside funding campaigns or accompanying a pet of the week slot. Meta tags
will also be utilised to increase visibility in search engine results for related topics
pertaining to the function of the charity, which also feeds into how the long-term goal
will be achieved. Success for this main goal will be measured by comparing both the
frequency of donations and donation amounts received against these metrics from before
the site went live. The number of users landing on the site and their journey through it
could also be measured with the use of web analytics tools and used as a marker of success
from a visibility and accessibility perspective.

Secondary goals will be achieved by including pages dedicated to each
objective with relevant information, including forms for donating and volunteering
opportunities. Success would be measured for each of these by recording changes to
the following:
- The frequency and variety of pets referred to the centre and ultimately adopted
(including interest in the pet of the week)
- The amount of people applying for volunteering opportunities, and number of opportunities
available
- The amount and frequency of donations before, during and after funding campaigns

In addition, user feedback pertaining to the website's design, in particular from users with additional
accessibility requirements, would be sought to measure qualitative success on this goal.
